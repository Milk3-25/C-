//            Your program will ask the user for 2 integers and then display a menu giving a choice of:
//A - Addition
//S - Subraction
//M - Multiplication
//D - Division
//The program will then ask the user which operation is wanted(Ask for A, S, M or D to be typed in.)
//                    The output will show the 2 numbers that were entered, and the result of the operation.
//If any other character or decimal number is input, display an appropriate error message and end the program.
//For full marks, your code must also be fully annotated.
//Remember: **From now on all assignments will require full program development => PD(Program Development) Table or Flowchart prior to beginning Coding**
//When your program is completed show Mr.Van De Wiele your code to see it in operation
//You will be submitting your program code by copying it into a word document and submitting it to D2L and your flowchart or a PD table can be done by hand or on the computer.  Submit to Mr.Van De Wiele by  D2L or by hand as appropriate.
//Any questions ask in class.
